it's about jews, sunnis, protestants, catholics
long history of jewish banks in rome, nyc, london...

these people are concerned with religion for law, not ta'weel
we're not talking about sufis or mystic christians

jews dont want christians in politics & the opposite

# target audience

jews, christians and muslims who dont hate each other
they respect that there's validity in eachothers' deen
because they believe in the aaxirah & the unseen

they're not competing in implementing their own version of laws
they unite around allah & ibraheem

# enemies

there's christians who care about laws in the dunya and
they're not certain about the aaxirah
these people trade their aaxirah for the dunya
and they do ribaa, they want massive success in worldly affairs
and they have a lot of pride in their achievements and knowledge

no reason to reach out to them, their hearts are sealed
and they're blinded, deaf and mute

they seek to deceive the mo'mineen and allah
but they're only deceiving themselves but they don't perceive it that way

their hearts are diseased and they're refuters
they think they're absolutely on the right path

they corrupt the earth and when the environmentalists complain
they claim they're working for a better future

they mock the unseen and think it's foolish
and they go along with the creed of the believers
but when alone with their satans, they say we're with you
we were only mocking the believers
they have to defend themselves before the satans
because they fear they might leave them

allah mocks & misguides them

instead of accepting help from people who know better
they go their own way.

they're struggling for inspiration, they do siHr in the attempt
to be inspired, ...they have no empathy

people like mark & elon, who make their ribaa empires
and get casted out by their followers once they hit their climax
